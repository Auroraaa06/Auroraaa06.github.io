Hi! I'm a second year Robotics master student from University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interest includes computer vision, machine perception, machine learning, control and planning of autonomous systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mangharam](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/) of X-Lab from [School of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania. I was also advised by [Prof. Matni](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/nikolai-matni/) from [UPenn GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/).
